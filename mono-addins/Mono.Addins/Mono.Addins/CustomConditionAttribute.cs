/// <summary>
///     Base class for custom condition attributes.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     Custom condition attributes can be used to apply conditions to extensions.
///     All custom condition attributes must subclass CustomConditionAttribute.
///     All arguments and properties must be tagged with NodeAttribute.
///     The ID of the condition is the simple name of this class without the "Attribute"
///     or "ConditionAttribute" suffix. For example "FooConditionAttribute" maps to the
///     condition ID "Foo" and "BarAttribute" maps to "Bar".
/// </remarks>
